## Development Setup

```bash
# run locally
npm install
npm run precompile # optional, only needed if you change the templates
npm run dev
```

```bash
# build for production
npm install
npm run precompile
npm run build
# deploy dist folder
```

## How to update the templates

Templates are taken from the Data Contract CLI and are fetched directly from the repository.  
If you want to update them locally run `npm run update-templates`, which will also be automatically run in the build.

Optionally, you can specify a location to the templates folder of a local datacontract-cli repository (or any other location).  
Combined with `npm run dev`, the templates will be live reloaded.

```
npm run update-templates --datacontract-template-source="/my/path/to/datacontract-cli/datacontract/templates/"
```
